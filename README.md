# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

The objective of this repository is to enhance a professional developer’s ability to:

- Master the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
* Efficiently translate project needs into structured documentation.
+ Identify and categorize functional and non-functional requirements for scalable systems.
- Leverage tools like **Draw.io** for visual representation of system requirements.
* Establish clear acceptance criteria to ensure alignment with business and user goals.
+ Apply best practices to produce industry-standard documentation and diagrams.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requrement analysis is usually a technical process and a team effort where stakeholders and software developers determine the needs and conditions that a new or altered software product must meet. This process involves identifying, documenting, and analyzing these business requirements to ensure that they are clearly understood and feasible.

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- Helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, to define the scope of the project and laying a foundation for designing and developing the system, which then helps to avoid costly mistakes  later on.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**: This is where the team actively gathers detailed information about what the software needs to do from the identified stakeholders.
* **Requirement Elicitation**: This involves brainstorming sessions, focused grouped discussions and prototyping to gather detailed requirements and refine them.
+ **Requirement Documentation**: is putting all requirements in a document with a goal of creating a clear, detailed record of what the software needs to do and the constraints within which it must operate. The team typically creates a document called a **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**, which serves as a guide for everyone involved in the project. This document includes everything from the specific features the software must have, to the performance levels required, to the standards it must meet.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: This stage involves taking a closer look at the documented requirements to make sure they are realistic and workable.
* **Requirement Validation**: The final step in the requirements analysis process, which combines both validation and verification, is about confirming that the requirements actually meet the needs of the stakeholders and the goals of the project.

# Types of Requirements

**Functional requirements** describe what the product should do, while non-functional requirements place constraints on how the product should do it.

Functional requirements – as the name implies – refer to specific product functionality. Defining, measuring, and testing them is usually a straightforward task.

On the other hand, **non-functional requirements** (also known as "**quality requirements**" or "**quality attributes**") are more abstract. They impose constraints on the implementation of the functional requirements in terms of performance, security, reliability, scalability, portability, and so on.

# Use Case Diagrams

A use case diagram is a visual representation in Unified Modeling Language that depicts the interaction between a system and its users or "actors".

It is useful to help identifying and documenting the functional requirements of a system, facilitates commumication between developers, stakeholders and users by provinding a clear and visual representation of the system's functionality, help define the scope of the project and provide a high-level overview of how users interact with the system.

# Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria is a predefined conditions that must be met for a feature to be considered complete and acceptable by stakeholders.

## Why is it important?

- Ensure all parties have a clear understanding of feature requirements.
* Provide a basis for testing and validation.
+ Help in maintaining quality and meeting user expectations.
